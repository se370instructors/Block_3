"AY22-2 SE370: Lesson 22 - Data Visualization"

This is a shell file for your ggplot exercise. Follow the prompts below and knit the document for homework.

## Problem 1: Loading and exploring data

Run the below code to load and explore the flights data:

```{r}
flights <- read.csv('Flight_Data_JAN18_Southwest_EastCoast.csv')
flights <- flights[is.na(flights$DEP_DELAY) == FALSE, ]


```

Write code to output the names of the columns in the `flights` data here:

```{r}


```

Write code to output the number of rows in the `flights` data here:

```{r}

```

## Problem 2: Plotting delays

Create a histogram of delays using `ggplot`. Hint: lookup what `geom` you can use to make a histogram

```{r}
library(ggplot2)


```

Create a density plot of the same data.

```{r}

```

Separate the delays that are \<=1 hour from the delays that are \>1 hour. Create two separate histograms -- one for the shorter delays and one for the longer delays. Is it more beneficial/insightful now that you have two plots instead of one?

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

## Problem 3: Plotting Delays by Origin

Create a density plot that shows delays from BWI and GSP on the same ggplot:

Make BWI = blue and GSP = red.

```{r}

```

## Problem 4: Facets

Use `facet_wrap()` to create a plot showing the density of DEP_DELAY for all DEST_CITY_NAME.

```{r}

```

Now, re-do the plot with delays \> 60 minutes filtered out...(only delays 1 hour or less included)

```{r}

```

## Problem 5: Titles and Aesthetics

Go back and make sure every plot has the following:

1.  A centered title that describes what the chart is
2.  Axis titles that are descriptive not all caps or all lowercase
3.  Change the color of your lines/bars to something different

## Bonus Problem

Make a "dumbbell plot" that shows the min, max, and average `DEP_DELAY` based on the `ORIGIN_CITY_NAME`. Be sure to do the following:

1.  Use `dplyr` to do the necessary data manipulation so that you have min, max, and average departure delay by origin city
2.  Plot the minimum departure delay as a BLUE point.
3.  Plot the maximum departure delay as a RED point.
4.  Plot the average departure delay with a different marker ("point shape").
5.  Use a segment/line to connect the in delay to the max delay.

*HINT: Google "dumbbell plot ggplot2" and see where it leads you! This is similar to the plot we ask for in \#2 of the problem set.*

```{r}

```
